# Logs Directory

This directory stores all log files generated by the infrastructure provisioning simulator.

## Purpose
The logs in this folder provide a record of:
- Provisioning lifecycle events  
- Validation outcomes  
- Service installation steps  
- Errors and exceptions from Python and Bash components  

## Usage
- Python logging outputs are written to `provisioning.log`.  
- Bash scripts append relevant operational messages to the same log file.  
- Logs are automatically generated whenever the provisioning tool is executed.
